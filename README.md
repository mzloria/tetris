# tetris

This is my version of the famous Tetris game. I coded the frontend of the program.
In this program, I allowed the user to be able to customize certain aspects of the 
game. Some of the aspects that the user can customize are block color, whether or
not they want grid lines on the board, and board size. The game also gives the user
the ability to play as many games as they want. The timer also speeds up each time
the player levels up.
